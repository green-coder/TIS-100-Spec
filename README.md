# TIS-100 Spec

A Clojure Spec based grammar for the TIS-100 programming language.

This is a toy project, don't expect anything from it except maybe learning how Clojure Spec is working and experimenting on that.

It won't be maintained and might be replaced later by another grammar for another kind of DIY Spec which does funny things.

## Usage

The grammar is to be conformed onto a sequence of chars.
